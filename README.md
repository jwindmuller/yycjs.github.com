### The YYCjs Website

Built with love by Eric Kryski ([@ekryski](http://twitter.com/ekryski)) and David Luecke ([@daffl](http://twitter.com/daffl)), [yycjs.com](http://yycjs.com) is the best source for finding out what's going on with JavaScript in Calgary. Check out the site to find out more about what we do, where we do it and what we believe in!

Being a JavaScript group, this site is a pure client side app that was **handcrafted with no back-end, CMS, or blog engine**. You'll find out more about how we built it on our blog that's coming soon...
